Minimally sized neighbourhoods are initially determined from these Euclidean distances, and expression profiles are shared between neighbouring cells. Then, the resultant smoothed matrix is used as input to the next step of smoothing, where the size (k) of the considered neighbourhoods is increased, leading to greater smoothing. This process continues until a chosen maximum k value has been reached, at which point the iteratively smoothed object is then optionally scaled to yield a final result.",

A t-step markov process is then calculated, by powering this affinity matrix t times. Finally, the powered affinity matrix is right-multiplied by the normalised data, causing the final imputed values to take the value of a per-gene average weighted by the affinities of cells. The resultant imputed matrix is then rescaled, to more closely match the magnitude of measurements in the normalised (input) matrix.",
