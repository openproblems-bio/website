    "dataset_description": "Understanding the function of genes and their regulation in tissue homeostasis and disease requires knowing the cellular context in which genes are expressed in tissues across the body. Single cell genomics allows the generation of detailed cellular atlases in human tissues, but most efforts are focused on single tissue types. Here, we establish a framework for profiling multiple tissues across the human body at single-cell resolution using single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-seq), and apply it to 8 diverse, archived, frozen tissue types (three donors per tissue). We apply four snRNA-seq methods to each of 25 samples from 16 donors, generating a cross-tissue atlas of 209,126 nuclei profiles, and benchmark them vs. scRNA-seq of comparable fresh tissues. We use a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to integrate an atlas across tissues, donors, and laboratory methods. We highlight shared and tissue-specific features of tissue-resident immune cells, identifying tissue-restricted and non-restricted resident myeloid populations. These include a cross-tissue conserved dichotomy between LYVE1- and HLA class II-expressing macrophages, and the broad presence of LAM-like macrophages across healthy tissues that is also observed in disease. For rare, monogenic muscle diseases, we identify cell types that likely underlie the neuromuscular, metabolic, and immune components of these diseases, and biological processes involved in their pathology. For common complex diseases and traits analyzed by GWAS, we identify the cell types and gene modules that potentially underlie disease mechanisms. The experimental and analytical frameworks we describe will enable the generation of large-scale studies of how cellular and molecular processes vary across individuals and populations.",

    "dataset_summary": "Multimodal single cell sequencing implicates chromatin accessibility and genetic background in diabetic kidney disease progression",
    "dataset_description": "Multimodal single cell sequencing is a powerful tool for interrogating cell-specific changes in transcription and chromatin accessibility. We performed single nucleus RNA (snRNA-seq) and assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq) on human kidney cortex from donors with and without diabetic kidney disease (DKD) to identify altered signaling pathways and transcription factors associated with DKD. Both snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq had an increased proportion of VCAM1+ injured proximal tubule cells (PT_VCAM1) in DKD samples. PT_VCAM1 has a pro-inflammatory expression signature and transcription factor motif enrichment implicated NFkB signaling. We used stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression to partition heritability of kidney-function-related traits using publicly-available GWAS summary statistics. Cell-specific PT_VCAM1 peaks were enriched for heritability of chronic kidney disease (CKD), suggesting that genetic background may regulate chromatin accessibility and DKD progression. snATAC-seq found cell-specific differentially accessible regions (DAR) throughout the nephron that change accessibility in DKD and these regions were enriched for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) motifs. Changes in chromatin accessibility were associated with decreased expression of insulin receptor, increased gluconeogenesis, and decreased expression of the GR cytosolic chaperone, FKBP5, in the diabetic proximal tubule. Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) profiling of GR binding in bulk kidney cortex and an in vitro model of the proximal tubule (RPTEC) showed that DAR co-localize with GR binding sites. CRISPRi silencing of GR response elements (GRE) in the FKBP5 gene body reduced FKBP5 expression in RPTEC, suggesting that reduced FKBP5 chromatin accessibility in DKD may alter cellular response to GR. We developed an open-source tool for single cell allele specific analysis (SALSA) to model the effect of genetic background on gene expression. Heterozygous germline single nucleotide variants (SNV) in proximal tubule ATAC peaks were associated with allele-specific chromatin accessibility and differential expression of target genes within cis-coaccessibility networks. Partitioned heritability of proximal tubule ATAC peaks with a predicted allele-specific effect was enriched for eGFR, suggesting that genetic background may modify DKD progression in a cell-specific manner.",

To systematically resolve immune cell heterogeneity across tissues, we developed CellTypist, a machine learning tool for rapid and precise cell type annotation. Using this approach, combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells. Our multitissue approach lays the foundation for identifying highly resolved immune cell types by leveraging a common reference dataset, tissue-integrated expression analysis, and antigen receptor sequencing.",
