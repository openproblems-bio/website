  "task_summary": "Predicting the profiles of one modality (e.g. protein abundance) from another (e.g. mRNA expression).",
  "task_description": "Experimental techniques to measure multiple modalities within the same single cell are increasingly becoming available. \nThe demand for these measurements is driven by the promise to provide a deeper insight into the state of a cell. \nYet, the modalities are also intrinsically linked. We know that DNA must be accessible (ATAC data) to produce mRNA \n(expression data), and mRNA in turn is used as a template to produce protein (protein abundance). These processes \nare regulated often by the same molecules that they produce: for example, a protein may bind DNA to prevent the production \nof more mRNA. Understanding these regulatory processes would be transformative for synthetic biology and drug target discovery. \nAny method that can predict a modality from another must have accounted for these regulatory processes, but the demand for \nmulti-modal data shows that this is not trivial.\n",
