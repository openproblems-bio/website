  "task_description": "Cellular function is regulated by the complex interplay of different types of biological\nmolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.), which determine the state of a cell. Several\nrecently described technologies allow for simultaneous measurement of different aspects\nof cellular state. For example, sci-CAR [@cao2018joint]\njointly profiles RNA expression and chromatin accessibility on the same cell and\nCITE-seq [@stoeckius2017simultaneous] measures\nsurface protein abundance and RNA expression from each cell. These technologies enable\nus to better understand cellular function, however datasets are still rare and there are\ntradeoffs that these measurements make for to profile multiple modalities.\n\nJoint methods can be more expensive or lower throughput or more noisy than measuring a\nsingle modality at a time. Therefore it is useful to develop methods that are capable\nof integrating measurements of the same biological system but obtained using different\ntechnologies on different cells.\n\n\nIn this task, the goal is to learn a latent space where cells profiled by different\ntechnologies in different modalities are matched if they have the same state. We use\njointly profiled data as ground truth so that we can evaluate when the observations\nfrom the same cell acquired using different modalities are similar. A perfect result\nhas each of the paired observations sharing the same coordinates in the latent space.\nA method that can achieve this would be able to match datasets across modalities to\nenable multimodal cellular analysis from separately measured profiles.\n",
