  "task_description": ["Recent developments in deep-learning have led to the creation of several 'foundation models' for single-cell data. These are large models that have been trained on data from millions of cells and am to fully capture the variability in the single-cell landscape. Typically, they use a transformer architecture [@szalata2024transformers] and undergo self-supervised pre-training using masking of parts of the input data. Trained foundation models can then be applied to a variety of downstream tasks, either by directly feeding new data into the model or by fine-tuning to better fit a new dataset or to produce a specific output. The general nature of single-cell foundation models and the large amount of data they have been trained on makes them potentially powerful tools for single-cell analysis but their performance is yet to be fully established.\n\nOpen Problems builds on existing evaluations [@boiarsky2023foundationmodels; @liu2024foundationmodels] of foundation models by incorporating them into our continuous benchmarking framework.\n\nThis overview combines results from the following benchmarks for individual tasks:\n\n- [Label projection](../label_projection)\n- [Batch Integration](../batch_integration)"],
