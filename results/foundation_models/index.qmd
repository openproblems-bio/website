## Interpretation

The foundation models task combines results for multiple analysis tasks and therefore should be interpreted differently.
We treat each task as a metric that means the overall performance of a foundation model on that type of analysis.
For more information about how foundation models perform at specific aspects of each task you should refer to that tasks results page.
As well as comparing between foundation models we provide additional context by including representative standard methods for each task, allowing us to see how foundation models compare to more established methods.

The high hardware and computational requirements of some foundation models present additional challenges for benchmarking and make it difficult to obtain results in some cases.
