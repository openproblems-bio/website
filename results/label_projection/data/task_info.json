  "task_description": "A major challenge for integrating single cell datasets is creating matching\ncell type annotations for each cell. One of the most common strategies for\nannotating cell types is referred to as\n[\"cluster-then-annotate\"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0088-9)\nwhereby cells are aggregated into clusters based on feature similarity and\nthen manually characterized based on differential gene expression or previously\nidentified marker genes. Recently, methods have emerged to build on this\nstrategy and annotate cells using\n[known marker genes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0535-3).\nHowever, these strategies pose a difficulty for integrating atlas-scale\ndatasets as the particular annotations may not match.\n\n\nTo ensure that the cell type labels in newly generated datasets match\nexisting reference datasets, some methods align cells to a previously\nannotated [reference dataset](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/22/4688/54802990)\nand then _project_ labels from the reference to the new dataset.\n\nHere, we compare methods for annotation based on a reference dataset.\nThe datasets consist of two or more samples of single cell profiles that\nhave been manually annotated with matching labels. These datasets are then\nsplit into training and test batches, and the task of each method is to\ntrain a cell type classifer on the training set and project those labels\nonto the test set.\n",
