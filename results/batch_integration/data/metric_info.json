The test is repeated for a random subset\nof cells, and the results are summarized as a rejection rate over all tested\nneighborhoods. Thus, kBET works on a kNN graph.\n\nWe compute kNN graphs where k = 50 for joint embeddings and corrected feature outputs\nvia Scanpy preprocessing steps. To test for technical effects and to account for\ncell-type frequency shifts across datasets, we applied kBET\nseparately on the batch variable for each cell identity label. Using the kBET defaults,\na k equal to the median of the number of cells per batch within each label is used for\nthis computation. Additionally, we set the minimum and maximum thresholds of k to 10 and\n100, respectively. As kNN graphs that have been subset by cell identity labels may no\nlonger be connected, we compute kBET per connected component. If >25% of cells were\nassigned to connected components too small for kBET computation (smaller than k‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ3),\nwe assigned a kBET score of 1 to denote poor batch removal. Subsequently, kBET scores\nfor each label were averaged and subtracted from 1 to give a final kBET score.\n\nIn Open Problems we do not run kBET on graph outputs to avoid computation-intensive\ndiffusion processes being run.\n",
