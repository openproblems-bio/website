The best score, and upper bound, is 1.0. There is no fixed lower bound for the metric. The uniform/non-weighted average across all cell types/states is used to summarise performance. By default, cases resulting in a score of NaN (perfect predictions) or -Inf (imperfect predictions) are replaced with 1.0 (perfect predictions) or 0.0 (imperfect predictions) respectively.\n",
