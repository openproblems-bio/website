## Summary
::::

::::{.section-content}
Scaling from a dozen cells a decade ago to millions of cells today, single-cell measurement technologies are driving a revolution in the life sciences. Recent advances make it possible to measure multiple high-dimensional modalities (e.g. DNA accessibility, RNA, and proteins) simultaneously in the same cell. Such data provides, for the first time, a direct and comprehensive view into the layers of gene regulation that drive biological diversity and disease.

In this competition for [NeurIPS 2021](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/CompetitionTrack), we present three tasks on multimodal single-cell data using a first-of-its-kind multi-omics benchmarking dataset. Teams will predict one modality from another and learn representations of multiple modalities measured in the same cells. Progress will reveal how a common genetic blueprint gives rise to distinct cell types and processes, as a foundation for improving human health.

## Details
::::

::::{.section-content}
The competition will focus on three tasks:

1. **Predicting one modality from another** - Given one modality, predict the other.
2. **Modality alignment** - Re-align multi-modal data measured in the same cells when we hide the correspondences between the two measurements.
3. **Learning a joint embedding** - Learn a meaningful embedding of multimodal data measured in the same cells that preserves expert-annotated data organization

To get started:

1.  Read [about the tasks](/events/2021-09_neurips/documentation/about_tasks/index.qmd) and the [submission quickstart](/events/2021-09_neurips/documentation/submission/quickstart.qmd) on our competition website
2.  View the [starter kit contents](/events/2021-09_neurips/documentation/submission/starter_kit_contents.qmd)
4.  Explore the data and prototype methods for free on [Saturn Cloud](/events/2021-09_neurips/documentation/about/explore.qmd) (Optional)
5.  Implement your method and [generate a submission](/events/2021-09_neurips/documentation/submission/development_process.qmd)!

Full details about all the above can be found in the [Competition Documentation](/events/2021-09_neurips/documentation/index.qmd).
