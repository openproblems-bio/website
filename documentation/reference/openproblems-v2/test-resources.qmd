This directory contains the test resources required for running unit tests on the Viash components. 

:::{.callout-note}
These test resources are not stored within the git repository. Instead, they are obtained by running the sync test resources component (See ["Getting started"](/documentation/fundamentals/getting_started.qmd)).
