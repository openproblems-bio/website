## Merge upstream repository

When you want to contribute your changes back to the OpenProblems repository, you might need to merge the upstream main branch into your fork. This ensures that your changes are based on the latest version of the code. To do this, enter the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/openproblems-bio/openproblems-v2.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
