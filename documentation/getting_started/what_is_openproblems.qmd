OpenProblems is a living benchmarking platform designed to address and measure progress towards open challenges in single-cell genomics. It follows the Common Task Framework (CTF) [@donoho2017yearsdatascience], which has driven innovation in machine learning research by providing clear definitions and quantifications of progress. 

The platform combines an open GitHub repository with community-defined tasks, an automated benchmarking workflow, and a website for exploring the results. Each task consists of datasets, methods, and metrics ([@fig-task-structure]). Datasets define the input and ground truth for a task, methods attempt to solve the task, and metrics evaluate the success of a method on a given dataset.

A key feature of OpenProblems is the use of [Viash](https://viash.io) components, which ensures that every component can be implemented in Python or R, has a well-defined API, is unit tested, and is made reproducible using customisable Docker images [@cannoodt2021viashfromscripts]. Viash components make it easy for developers to create, maintain, and share components while ensuring consistency and interoperability across the platform.

To facilitate seamless community involvement, OpenProblems has designed its infrastructure to take advantage of automated workflows through GitHub Actions, Nextflow, and AWS Batch, as well as the integration of Viash components ([@fig-project-structure]). When a community member adds a task, dataset, method, or metric, the new contributions are automatically tested in the cloud. Once all tests pass and the new contribution is merged into the main repository, the results from the new contribution are automatically submitted to the OpenProblems website.

OpenProblems aims to raise the standards for method selection and evaluation in single-cell data science by offering a platform that quantitatively defines open challenges, determines current state-of-the-art solutions, promotes method development, and monitors progress towards these goals. By leveraging Viash components, the platform ensures consistency, modularity, and interoperability, making it a valuable resource for data analysts, method developers, and the single-cell genomics community at large.
