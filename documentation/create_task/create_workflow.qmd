Once dataset processor, method and metric components are created, it is time to combine them into a workflow.
A workflow is a sequence of components that are executed in a specific order.

The standard workflow is as follows:

1. Dataset processing
2. Running methods (run methods in parallel)
3. Evaluation (applying metrics and aggregating results)

<!-- TODO: diagram of example workflow -->

## Build the main workflow with Nextflow

```{groovy}
#| eval: false

nextflow.enable.dsl=2

workflow {
    // Insert beatiful example pipeline here
}

```
