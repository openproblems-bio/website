This chapter provides a step-by-step overview of the process, including understanding the typical structure of an OpenProblems task, defining a new task, selecting datasets, designing the API for files and components, adding components, and creating a workflow that ties everything together.

Here are the main sections of this guide, each represented by a file with headers:

1. **[Task Structure](task_structure.qmd)**: The structure of a typical OpenProblems task, including its components and file formats.

2. **[Define the Task](define_task.qmd)**: How to plan and document your task before diving into the code, including creating a README and submitting it to the OpenProblems community.

3. **[Design the API](design_api.qmd)**: Design a consistent API for your task components and input/output files, and learn how to create API files for each component.

4. **[Select Datasets](select_datasets.qmd)**: How to choose appropriate datasets for your task and create a dataset processing component to handle the data.

5. **[Create Components](create_components.qmd)**: Dive into the process of adding components to your task, such as dataset loaders, methods, control methods, and metrics.

6. **[Create Workflow](create_workflow.qmd)**: Combine your components into a cohesive Nextflow workflow.

By following this guide, you'll gain a thorough understanding of the process and best practices for creating a new OpenProblems task from scratch.
