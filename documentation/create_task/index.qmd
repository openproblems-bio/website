A task is a set of components that are used to evaluate existing methods that tackle a specific problem.
Some examples that are currently implemented in openproblems are batch integration, label projection and dimensionality reduction.
In the following we will show you how to create a new task from scratch.

The main parts that make up a task are:

* a written [task description](create_task_proposal.qmd)
* generic, but task specific API specifications for the [components](api_component_specs.qmd) and the [file formats](api_file_formats.qmd) 
* a [dataset processing](api_masking_component.qmd) component for preparing the data for the method and metric inputs
* [method](create_methods.qmd) and [metric](create_metrics.qmd) components that adhere to the API specifications
* a [baseline](create_baselines.qmd) method for comparison
* a [testing framework](test_framework.qmd)


<!-- Steps to follow:

- [Creating the file format specifications](api_file_formats.qmd)
- [Creating the component specifications](api_component_specs.qmd)
- Create masking component
- Generate testing resources
- Create method
- Create metric
- Add unit tests
- Create baseline methods
- [Add task metadata](task_metadata.qmd) -->
