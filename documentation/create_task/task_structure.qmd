title: Task structure
order: 5

Before defining a new {{< glossary task >}} in OpenProblems, it's important to understand the typical structure of an OpenProblems task (@fig-task-workflow).

A task typically consists of a dataset processor, methods, control methods and metrics. Each component has a well-defined input-output interface, for which the file formats in the resulting AnnData are also described.

{{< include /documentation/_figures/_project_structure_task_workflow.qmd >}}


## File and component formats

Path: `src/tasks/<task_id>/api`

This folder contains task-specific {{< glossary File format specification label="file formats" >}} and {{< glossary Component interface label="component interfaces" >}}. More specifically:

* `task_info.yaml`: The task name, description and other metadata.
* `file_*.yaml`: File format specifications for the task.
* `comp_*.yaml`: Component interface specifications for the task.
* `thumbnail.svg`: A thumbnail image for the task.

## Dataset processor

Path: `src/tasks/<task_id>/process_dataset`

The {{< glossary data processor >}} transforms a {{< glossary common dataset >}} into task-specific dataset objects. In supervised tasks, this component will usually output a solution, a training dataset and a test dataset. In unsupervised tasks, this component usually output a solution and a masked dataset.

## Methods

Path: `src/tasks/<task_id>/methods`

This folder contains {{< glossary method >}} components. Each method component outputs a prediction given the training and test datasets (when applicable).

## Control methods

Path: `src/tasks/<task_id>/control_methods`

This folder contains {{< glossary control methods >}} for the task. These components have the same interface as the regular methods but also receive the solution object as input.  It serves as a starting point to test the relative accuracy of new methods in the task, and also as a quality control for the metrics defined in the task. A control method can either be a positive control or a negative control, which set a maximum and minimum threshold for performance, so any new method should perform better than the negative control methods and worse than the positive control method.

A *positive control* is a method where the expected results are known, thus resulting in the best possible value for any metric outcome measure.

A *negative control* is a simple, naive, or random method that does not rely on any sophisticated techniques or domain knowledge. 

## Metrics

Path: `src/tasks/<task_id>/metrics`

This folder contains {{< glossary metric >}} components. Each metric component outputs one or more metric results given a solution object and a method output object.

## Benchmarking pipeline

Path: `src/tasks/<task_id>/workflows`

This folder contains a {{< glossary Nextflow >}} workflow defining the benchmarking workflow for this task.

## Resource generation scripts

Path: `src/tasks/<task_id>/resources_scripts`

This folder contains scripts for generating benchmarking resources required for the task.

## Test resource generation scripts

Path: `src/tasks/<task_id>/resources_test_scripts`

This folder contains scripts for generating test resources for the task.
