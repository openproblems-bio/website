Before writing any code, it's essential to carefully plan and document your task to ensure its relevance, feasibility, and compatibility with the OpenProblems framework. 

# Step 1: Check whether a similar task already exists

Please check the [OpenProblems tasks](https://github.com/openproblems-bio/openproblems-v2/labels/task) to see whether a similar task has already been created.

# Step 2: Create a GitHub issue

If not, [create a new issue](https://github.com/openproblems-bio/openproblems-v2/issues/new?assignees=&labels=task&projects=&template=new_task.yml) and fill in the required information.

This collaborative process will help ensure that your task is well-defined, relevant, and compatible with the OpenProblems framework. Additionally, it informs others of your ongoing work in this area and establishes a foundation for potential collaboration.

```{r include=FALSE}
new_task_yml <- yaml::read_yaml("_openproblems-v2/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new_task.yml")
md <- paste(sapply(new_task_yml$body, function(section) {
  if (section$type == "textarea") {
    paste0("## ", section$attributes$label, "\n\n", section$attributes$description, "\n")
  } else {
    ""
  }
}), collapse = "\n")

knitr::asis_output(md)
```

# Step 3: Create task info

Now create a task info metadata file at `src/tasks/<task_id>/api/task_info.yaml`:

```{.yaml filename="src/tasks/<task_id>/api/task_info.yaml"}
task_id: your_task_id
task_name: Your task name
summary: "FILL IN: A one line description of what this purpose of this task is."
description: |
  FILL IN: The task description and motivation you created earlier.
authors:
  - name: "Your name"
    roles: [ author, maintainer ]
    props:
      github: your-github-account
      orcid: "0000-1111-2222-3333"
```

# Next steps

You are now well-equipped to begin [designing the API](design_api.qmd) for the new benchmarking task.
