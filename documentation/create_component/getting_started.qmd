To get started with contributing to OpenProblems, you'll need to fork and clone the OpenProblems repository task to your local machine.

## Step 1: Create a fork

Go to the OpenProblems organisation at [https://github.com/openproblems-bio](https://github.com/openproblems-bio) and search for the task repository you want to start contributing to. Open the repository and click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page.

This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

While you're at it, why not click the "Star" button as well?

## Step 2: Clone the repository
To clone this forked repository to your local machine, copy the URL of the forked repository by clicking the green "Code" button and selecting HTTPS or SSH.

In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and enter the following command:

```bash
git clone --recursive <forked repository URL>
cd <repository name>
```

This will download a copy of the repository to your local machine. You can now make changes to the code, add new functionality, and commit your changes. Please commit your changes to a new branch following the [branch naming convention](/documentation/reference/naming/index.qmd).

If somehow there are no files visible in the `common` submodule after cloning using the above command. Use the following command to update the submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
:::

## Step 3: Download test resources

You will also need to download the test resources by running the following command.
These are needed for testing the existing components and can be used for developing new unit tests.
From the repository root, run:

```bash
scripts/sync_resources.sh
```
<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>
```{bash}
#| echo: false
rm -r resources_test
scripts/sync_resources.sh
```
</details>

The test resources are stored in the `resources_test` directory.


## Ready, set, go!

That's it! Now you should be able to test whether the existing components work as expected and then start adding functionality to the pipeline. Running an existing component is as simple as running a command in your terminal. Using test data as input, you can try this out immediately.

### Run a component

Use the `viash run` command to run a Viash component. Everything after the `--` separator counts as the arguments of the component itself. In this case, the `logistic_regression` component has an `--input_train` and `--input_test` argument to which the test resources are passed.

```bash
viash run src/methods/logistic_regression/config.vsh.yaml -- \
  --input_train resources_test/task_template/pancreas/train.h5ad \
  --input_test resources_test/task_template/pancreas/test.h5ad \
  --output output.h5ad
```
<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>
```{bash}
#| echo: false
viash run src/methods/logistic_regression/config.vsh.yaml -- \
  --input_train resources_test/task_template/pancreas/train.h5ad \
  --input_test resources_test/task_template/pancreas/test.h5ad \
  --output output.h5ad
```
</details>

### Testing components

Testing components is an important part of the development process.
Each tasks comes with pre-defined unit tests that can be run using the `viash test` command.

```bash
viash test src/methods/logistic_regression/config.vsh.yaml
```
<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>
```{bash}
#| echo: false
viash test src/methods/logistic_regression/config.vsh.yaml
```
</details>

If you want to run the unit tests for all of the components of a task, you can use the `viash ns test` command.

```bash
viash ns test --parallel --engine docker
```
