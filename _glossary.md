```glossary:Task
A benchmarking task to evaluate the performance of different methods in solving a specific problem when analysing omics data.
```

```glossary:Metric
A quantitative measure used to evaluate the performance of different methods in solving a specific problem.
```

```glossary:Control method
Is used to test the relative performance of all other methods, and also as a quality control for the pipeline as a whole.
```

```glossary:Method
A technique to solve a specific problem when analysing omics data.
Dataset: A single-cell omics dataset. This is typically in the form of one or more AnnData files derived from a dataset loader and processed by the dataset processing workflow.
```

```glossary:AnnData
AnnData, short for "Annotated Data", is a file format for handling annotated,
high-dimensional biological data [@virshup2021anndataannotateddata]. It is
a standard data format in the single-cell community, and is supported by
many single-cell analysis tools, including Scanpy and CellxGene.

AnnData objects have a structured format that includes 
the main data matrix (`X`, e.g. gene expression values), 
annotations of observations (`obs`, e.g. cell metadata),
annotations of variables (`var`, e.g. gene metadata),
and unstructured annotations (`uns`).
This organization makes it easy to work with complex datasets while maintaining
data integrity and ensuring a standardized structure across different components.

Files with the `.h5ad` extension represent AnnData objects stored in an HDF5 file.
AnnData objects can be opened in Python using the
[`anndata.read_h5ad()`](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/anndata.read_h5ad.html#anndata.read_h5ad)
function, and in R using the
[`anndata::read_h5ad()`](https://anndata.dynverse.org/reference/read_h5ad.html)
function. Technically it can be read in any language using an HDF5 library.
