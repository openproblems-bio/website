## Organizing Team

_In alphabetical order_

-   **Daniel Burkhardt** (<a href="mailto:dburkhardt@cellarity.com?subject=%5BNeurIPS_2021%5D" style="color: #EB5252;">Primary contact</a>) is a Machine Learning
    Scientist at [Cellarity.](https://cellarity.com) He is a core organizer of the Open Problems
    in Single-Cell Analysis. Daniel completed his PhD in Genetics at
    Yale University with a specialization in machine learning under the
    supervision of Smita Krishnaswamy.

-   **Smita Krishnaswamy** is an associate professor of Computer Science and
    Genetics at Yale University. Her research focuses on unsupervised
    learning, using data geometry, topology and deep learning methods
    for big biomedical data. She is a faculty advisor for Open Problems
    in Single-Cell Analysis.

-   **Malte Lücken** is a senior postdoctoral researcher and team leader
    for integrative single-cell analysis in the Machine Learning Group
    of Prof. Fabian Theis. His research focuses on evaluating
    computational methods for single-cell analysis and investigating how
    environmental stimuli and natural variation manifests on the level
    of single cells.

-   **Debora Marks** is an
    Associate Professor in the Department of Systems Biology at Harvard
    Medical School. Over the past five years, her lab has
    developed methods that accelerate structural biology with
    applications to cryoEM, crystallography, protein design and computed
    3D structures of thousands of proteins with unknown folds, protein
    complexes and RNA interactions, as well as flexible, dynamic and
    even disordered protein ensembles.

-   **Angela Pisco** is the Associate Director of Bioinformatics at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.
    Her group is responsible for generating and annotated atlas-scale single-cell
    datasets across biological systems.

-   **Bastian Rieck** is a senior assistant in the Machine Learning and
    Computational Biology Lab of Prof. Dr. Karsten Borgwardt at ETH
    Zurich. His main research interests are manifold learning approaches
    based on concepts from topological data analysis, with a focus on
    personalized medicine and computational biology.

-   **Jian Tang** is currently an assistant professor at HEC Montreal
    (business school of University of Montreal) and a core faculty
    member at Mila-Quebec AI Institute. His research focuses on graph
    representation learning, graph neural networks, drug discovery, and
    knowledge graphs.

-   **Fabian Theis** is the Professor of Mathematical Modeling of Biological
    Systems at the Department of Mathematics of the Technical University
    of Munich; the director of the Institute of Computational Biology,
    Helmholtz Zentrum München; the scientific director of the Helmholtz
    Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Unit; and a faculty member of
    the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK. His lab develops innovative
    methods for single-cell analysis.

-   **Alexander Tong** is a PhD candidate in Computer Science in the lab of
    Prof. Smita Krishnaswamy at Yale University. His research focuses on
    manifold learning and optimal transport with a focus on single-cell
    data. Alexander will be responsible for supporting the comparison
    infrastructure and evaluating submissions.

-   **Guy Wolf** is an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics
    and Statistics at the Université de Montréal and a Core Member of
    Mila---the Québec AI Institute. His research
    focuses on manifold learning, representation learning, and geometric
    deep learning for exploratory data analysis, including methods for
    dimensionality reduction, visualization, denoising, data
    augmentation, and coarse graining, with particular focus on
    applications in biomedical data exploration.
