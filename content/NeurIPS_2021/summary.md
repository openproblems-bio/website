Innovations in single-cell measurement technologies are driving a revolution in the life sciences. Recent advances make it possible to measure multiple modalities (e.g. chromatin accessibility / gene expression / protein) simultaneously in the same cell. These datasets provide unique opportunities to understand the layers of gene regulation that drive biological diversity and disease. In this competition, we present three tasks crucial to fully leveraging multimodal single-cell data using a combination of publicly available datasets and a first-of-its-kind benchmarking multi-omics dataset. The tasks involve predicting one modality from another and learning representations of multiple modalities measured in the same cells.
