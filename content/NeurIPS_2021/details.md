The competition will focus on three tasks:
1. **Predicting one modality from another** - Given one modality, predict the other.
2. **Modality alignment** - Re-align multi-modal data measured in the same cells when we hide the correspondences between the two measurements.
3. **Learning a joint embedding** - Learn a meaningful embedding of multimodal data measured in the same cells that preserves expert-annotated data organization

To get started:

1.  Read [about the tasks](/neurips_docs/about_tasks) and the [submission quickstart](/neurips_docs/submission/quickstart/) on our competition website
2.  View the [starter kit contents](/neurips_docs/submission/starter_kit_contents)
4.  Explore the data and prototype methods for free on [Saturn Cloud](https://openproblems.bio/neurips_docs/about/explore) (Optional)
5.  Implement your method and [generate a submission](/neurips_docs/submission/development_process/)!

Full details about all the above can be found in the [Competition Documentation](/neurips_docs).
