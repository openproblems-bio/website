The competition will focus on three tasks:
1. **Predicting one modality from another** - given chromatin accessibility measured in tens of thousands of cells, predict the corresponding RNA expression for each cell
2. **Modality alignment** - re-align multi-modal data measured in the same cells when we hide the correspondences between the two measurements
3. **Learning a joint embedding** - learn a meaningful embedding of multimodal data measured in the same cells that preserves expert-annotated data organization

We will provide:
* A starter kit with minimal example submissions
* Public data curated to match the format of test datasets
* Purpose-generated training data matching held-out test datasets
