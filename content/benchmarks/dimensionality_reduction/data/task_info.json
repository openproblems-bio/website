    "task_description": "\nDimensionality reduction is one of the key challenges in single-cell data\nrepresentation. Routine single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments measure cells\nin roughly 20,000-30,000 dimensions (i.e., features - mostly gene transcripts but also\nother functional elements encoded in mRNA such as lncRNAs). Since its inception,\nscRNA-seq experiments have been growing in terms of the number of cells measured.\nOriginally, cutting-edge SmartSeq experiments would yield a few hundred cells, at best.\nNow, it is not uncommon to see experiments that yield over [100,000\ncells](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#tabula2018single) or even [> 1 million\ncells.](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#cao2020human)\n\nEach *feature* in a dataset functions as a single dimension. While each of the ~30,000\ndimensions measured in each cell contribute to an underlying data structure, the overall\nstructure of the data is challenging to display in few dimensions due to data sparsity\nand the [*\"curse of\ndimensionality\"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) (distances in\nhigh dimensional data don\u2019t distinguish data points well). Thus, we need to find a way\nto [dimensionally reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) the\ndata for visualization and interpretation.\n\n",
