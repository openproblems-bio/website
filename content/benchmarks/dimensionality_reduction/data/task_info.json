    "task_description": "\n## The task\n\nDimensionality reduction is one of the key challenges in single-cell data\nrepresentation. Routine single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments measure cells\nin roughly 20,000-30,000 dimensions (i.e., features - mostly gene transcripts but also\nother functional elements encoded in mRNA such as lncRNAs). Since its inception,\nscRNA-seq experiments have been growing in terms of the number of cells measured.\nOriginally, cutting-edge SmartSeq experiments would yield a few hundred cells, at best.\nNow, it is not uncommon to see experiments that yield over [100,000\ncells](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#tabula2018single) or even [> 1 million\ncells.](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#cao2020human)\n\nEach *feature* in a dataset functions as a single dimension. While each of the ~30,000\ndimensions measured in each cell contribute to an underlying data structure, the overall\nstructure of the data is challenging to display in few dimensions due to data sparsity\nand the [*\"curse of\ndimensionality\"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) (distances in\nhigh dimensional data don\u2019t distinguish data points well). Thus, we need to find a way\nto [dimensionally reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) the\ndata for visualization and interpretation.\n\n## The metrics\n\n* **Distance correlation**: the Spearman correlation between\n  ground truth distances in the high-dimensional data and Euclidean distances in the\n  dimension-reduced data, invariant to scalar multiplication. *Distance correlation*\n  computes high-dimensional distances in Euclidean space, while *Distance correlation\n  (spectral)* computes [diffusion distances](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acha.2006.04.006)\n  (i.e. Euclidean distances on the [Laplacian Eigenmap](http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089976603321780317)).\n* **Trustworthiness**: a measurement of similarity between the rank of each point's\n  nearest neighbors in the high-dimensional data and the reduced data ([Venna & Kaski,\n  2001](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#venna2001neighborhood)).\n* **Density preservation**: similarity between local densities in the high-dimensional\n  data and the reduced data ([Narayan, Berger & Cho,\n  2020](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#narayan2021assessing))\n* **NN Ranking**: a set of metrics from\n  [pyDRMetrics](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#zhang2021pydrmetrics) relating to\n  the preservation   of nearest neighbors in the high-dimensional data and the reduced\n  data.\n\n",
