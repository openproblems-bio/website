    "task_description": "Dimensionality reduction is one of the key challenges in single-cell data representation.\nRoutine single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments measure cells in roughly\n20,000-30,000 dimensions (i.e., features - mostly gene transcripts but also other functional\nelements encoded in mRNA such as lncRNAs). Since its inception,scRNA-seq experiments have\nbeen growing in terms of the number of cells measured. Originally, cutting-edge SmartSeq\nexperiments would yield a few hundred cells, at best. Now, it is not uncommon to see\nexperiments that yield over [100,000 cells](<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0590-4>)\nor even [> 1 million cells](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aba7721).\n\nEach *feature* in a dataset functions as a single dimension. While each of the ~30,000\ndimensions measured in each cell contribute to an underlying data structure, the overall\nstructure of the data is challenging to display in few dimensions due to data sparsity\nand the [*\"curse of dimensionality\"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)\n(distances in high dimensional data don't distinguish data points well). Thus, we need to find\na way to [dimensionally reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction)\nthe data for visualization and interpretation."
