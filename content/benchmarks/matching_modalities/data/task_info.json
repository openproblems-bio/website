    "task_description": "\nCellular function is regulated by the complex interplay of different types of biological\nmolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.), which determine the state of a cell. Several\nrecently described technologies allow for simultaneous measurement of different aspects\nof cellular state. For example, [sci-CAR](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#cao2018joint)\njointly profiles RNA expression and chromatin accessibility on the same cell and\n[CITE-seq](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#stoeckius2017simultaneous) measures\nsurface protein abundance and RNA expression from each cell. These technologies enable\nus to better understand cellular function, however datasets are still rare and there are\ntradeoffs that these measurements make for to profile multiple modalities.\n\nJoint methods can be more expensive or lower throughput or more noisy than measuring a\nsingle modality at a time. Therefore it is useful to develop methods that are capable\nof integrating measurements of the same biological system but obtained using different\ntechnologies on different cells.\n\nHere the goal is to learn a latent space where cells profiled by different technologies in\ndifferent modalities are matched if they have the same state. We use jointly profiled\ndata as ground truth so that we can evaluate when the observations from the same cell\nacquired using different modalities are similar. A perfect result has each of the paired\nobservations sharing the same coordinates in the latent space.\n\n",
