    "task_description": "\nThis is a sub-task of the overall batch integration task. Batch (or data) integration\nintegrates datasets across batches that arise from various biological and technical\nsources. Methods that integrate batches typically have three different types of output:\na corrected feature matrix, a joint embedding across batches, and/or an integrated\ncell-cell similarity graph (e.g., a kNN graph). This sub-task focuses on all methods\nthat can output feature matrices. Other sub-tasks for batch integration can be found\nfor:\n\n* [graphs](../batch_integration_graph/), and\n* [embeddings](../batch_integration_embed/)\n\nThis sub-task was taken from a [benchmarking study of data integration\nmethods](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#luecken2022benchmarking).\n\n",
