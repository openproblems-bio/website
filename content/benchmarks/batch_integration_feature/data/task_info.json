    "task_description": "<!--- TODO: add links --->\n\n\n## The task\n\nThis is a sub-task of the overall batch integration task. Batch (or data) integration\nintegrates datasets across batches that arise from various biological and technical\nsources. Methods that integrate batches typically have three different types of output:\na corrected feature matrix, a joint embedding across batches, and/or an integrated\ncell-cell similarity graph (e.g., a kNN graph). This sub-task focuses on all methods\nthat can output feature matrices. Other sub-tasks for batch integration can be found\nfor:\n\n* [graphs](../batch_integration_graph/), and\n* [embeddings](../batch_integration_embed/)\n\nThis sub-task was taken from a [benchmarking study of data integration\nmethods](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#luecken2022benchmarking).\n\n## The metrics\n\nMetrics for batch integration (feature) measure how well feature-level information is\nbatch corrected. This is only done on by capturing biological variance conservation.\nFurther metrics for batch correction and biological variance conservation that are\ncalculated on lower dimensional feature spaces extrapolated from corrected feature\noutputs can be found in the batch integration embed and graph tasks.\n\n* **HVG conservation**: This metric computes the average percentage of overlapping\nhighly variable genes per batch before and after integration.\n\n",
