Batch (or data) integration\nmethods integrate datasets across batches that arise from various biological and\ntechnical sources. Methods that integrate batches typically have three different types\nof output: a corrected feature matrix, a joint embedding across batches, and/or an\nintegrated cell-cell similarity graph (e.g., a kNN graph). This sub-task focuses on all\nmethods that can output integrated graphs, and includes methods that canonically output\nthe other two data formats with subsequent postprocessing to generate a graph. Other\nsub-tasks for batch integration can be found for:\n\n* [embeddings](../batch_integration_embed/), and\n* [corrected features](../batch_integration_feature/)\n\nThis sub-task was taken from a [benchmarking study of data integration\nmethods](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#luecken2022benchmarking).\n\n",
