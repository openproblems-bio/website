    "task_description": "<!--- TODO: add links --->\n\n\n## The task\n\nThis is a sub-task of the overall batch integration task. Batch (or data) integration\nmethods integrate datasets across batches that arise from various biological and\ntechnical sources. Methods that integrate batches typically have three different types\nof output: a corrected feature matrix, a joint embedding across batches, and/or an\nintegrated cell-cell similarity graph (e.g., a kNN graph). This sub-task focuses on all\nmethods that can output integrated graphs, and includes methods that canonically output\nthe other two data formats with subsequent postprocessing to generate a graph. Other\nsub-tasks for batch integration can be found for:\n\n* [embeddings](../batch_integration_embed/), and\n* [corrected features](../batch_integration_feature/)\n\nThis sub-task was taken from a [benchmarking study of data integration\nmethods](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#luecken2022benchmarking).\n\n## The metrics\n\nMetrics for batch integration (graph) measure how well batches are mixed while\nbiological signals are preserved. They are divided into batch correction and biological\nvariance conservation metrics.\n\n### Batch correction\n\n* **Graph connectivity**: The graph connectivity metric assesses whether the kNN graph\nrepresentation, G, of the integrated data connects all cells with the same cell identity\nlabel.\n\n### Biological variance removal\n\n* **Adjusted rand index (ARI)**: The Rand index compares the overlap of two clusterings;\nit considers both correct clustering overlaps while also counting correct disagreements\nbetween two clusterings.\n* **Iso label F1 score**: Isolated cell labels are identified as the labels present in\nthe least number of batches in the integration task. The score evaluates how well these\nisolated labels separate from other cell identities based on clustering.\n* **Normalized mutual information (NMI)**: NMI compares the overlap of two clusterings.\nWe used NMI to compare the cell-type labels with Louvain clusters computed on the\nintegrated dataset.\n\n",
