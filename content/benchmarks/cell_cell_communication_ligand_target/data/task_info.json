    "task_description": "\nThe growing availability of single-cell data has sparked an increased\ninterest in the inference of cell-cell communication (CCC),\nwith an ever-growing number of computational tools developed for this purpose.\n\nDifferent tools propose distinct preprocessing steps with diverse\nscoring functions, that are challenging to compare and evaluate.\nFurthermore, each tool typically comes with its own set of prior knowledge.\nTo harmonize these, [Dimitrov et\nal, 2022](https://openproblems.bio/bibliography#dimitrov2022comparison) recently\ndeveloped the [LIANA](https://github.com/saezlab/liana) framework, which was used\nas a foundation for this task.\n\nThe challenges in evaluating the tools are further exacerbated by the\nlack of a gold standard to benchmark the performance of CCC methods. In an\nattempt to address this, Dimitrov et al use alternative data modalities, including\nthe spatial proximity of cell types and\ndownstream cytokine activities, to generate an inferred ground truth. However,\nthese modalities are only approximations of biological reality and come\nwith their own assumptions and limitations. In time, the inclusion of more\ndatasets with known ground truth interactions will become available, from\nwhich the limitations and advantages of the different CCC methods will\nbe better understood.\n\n**This subtask evaluates the methods' ability to predict interactions,\nthe corresponding of cytokines of which, are inferred to be active in\nthe target cell types. This subtask focuses\non the prediction of interactions from steady-state, or single-context,\nsingle-cell data.**\n\n",
