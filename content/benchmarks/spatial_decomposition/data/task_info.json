    "task_summary": "Calling cell-type compositions for spot-based spatial transcriptomics data",
    "task_description": "\nSpatial decomposition (also often referred to as Spatial deconvolution) is\napplicable to spatial transcriptomics data where the transcription profile of\neach capture location (spot, voxel, bead, etc.) do not share a bijective\nrelationship with the cells in the tissue, i.e., multiple cells may contribute\nto the same capture location. The task of spatial decomposition then refers to\nestimating the composition of cell types/states that are present at each capture\nlocation. The cell type/states estimates are presented as proportion values,\nrepresenting the proportion of the cells at each capture location that belong to\na given cell type.\n\nWe distinguish between _reference-based_ decomposition and _de novo_\ndecomposition, where the former leverage external data (e.g., scRNA-seq or\nscNuc-seq) to guide the inference process, while the latter only work with the\nspatial data. We require that all datasets have an associated reference single\ncell data set, but methods are free to ignore this information.\n\n",
