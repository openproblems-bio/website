## Organizing Team

_In alphabetical order_

-   **Daniel Burkhardt** (<a href="mailto:dburkhardt@cellarity.com?subject=%5BNeurIPS_2021%5D" style="color: #EB5252;">Primary contact</a>) is a Machine Learning
    Scientist at [Cellarity.](https://cellarity.com) He is a core organizer of the Open Problems
    in Single-Cell Analysis. Daniel completed his PhD in Genetics at
    Yale University with a specialization in machine learning under the
    supervision of Smita Krishnaswamy.

-   **Jonathan M. Bloom** leads Perturbation Biology and Machine Learning at Cellarity. As an Institute Scientist at the Broad Institute, he cofounded the Hail team, Learning Meaningful Representations of Life, and Models, Inference & Algorithms, while contributing to sequencing benchmarks, statistical genetics, ML theory, and neuroscience efforts. Jonathan completed his PhD at Columbia and Moore Instructorship and NSF postdoc at MIT, conducting research on algebraic topology and geometry while reimagining the teaching of statistics.  

-   **Robrecht Cannoodt** is a postdoctoral researcher in Saeys lab at 
    VIB-UGent and a computer science consultant at Data Intuitive.
    During his PhD, his research was focused mainly on unsupervised learning in 
    single-cell omics, more specifically on trajectory inference. Robrecht 
    oversees infrastructure development for building collaborative, scalable 
    and reproducible pipelines using NextFlow and Viash.
    
-   **Peter Holderrieth** is a Machine Learning Scientist at Cellarity where he works on hit 
    prediction tools based on single-cell data. Previously, he was an Associate Scientist at 
    Genomics plc. Originally trained as a mathematician, he holds an MSc in Statistics and 
    MSc in Neuroscience from the University of Oxford.
    

-   **Smita Krishnaswamy** is an associate professor of Computer Science and
    Genetics at Yale University. Her research focuses on unsupervised
    learning, using data geometry, topology and deep learning methods
    for big biomedical data. She is a faculty advisor for Open Problems
    in Single-Cell Analysis.

-   **Christopher Lance** is a PhD candidate in the Machine Learning Group of Prof. Fabian Theis 
    at the Helmholtz Center Munich where he works on establishing best practices for analysing multimodal single-cell data
    and the integration of multiple modalities.

-   **Malte Lücken** is a senior postdoctoral researcher and team leader
    for integrative single-cell analysis in the Machine Learning Group
    of Prof. Fabian Theis. His research focuses on evaluating
    computational methods for single-cell analysis and investigating how
    environmental stimuli and natural variation manifests on the level
    of single cells.


-   **Angela Pisco** is the Associate Director of Bioinformatics at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.
    Her group is responsible for generating and annotated atlas-scale single-cell
    datasets across biological systems.

-   **Fabian Theis** is the Professor of Mathematical Modeling of Biological
    Systems at the Department of Mathematics of the Technical University
    of Munich; the director of the Institute of Computational Biology,
    Helmholtz Zentrum München; the scientific director of the Helmholtz
    Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Unit; and a faculty member of
    the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK. His lab develops innovative
    methods for single-cell analysis.
