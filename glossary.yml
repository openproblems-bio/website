Task: A benchmarking task to evaluate the performance of different methods in solving a specific problem when analysing omics data.
Metric: A quantitative measure used to evaluate the performance of different methods in solving a specific problem.
Control method: Is used to test the relative performance of all other methods, and also as a quality control for the pipeline as a whole.
Method: A technique to solve a specific problem when analysing omics data.
Dataset: A single-cell omics dataset. This is typically in the form of one or more AnnData files derived from a dataset loader and processed by the dataset processing workflow.
AnnData: A file format for handling annotated, high-dimensional biological data.
Viash: A framework for creating and executing modular, reproducible, and portable bioinformatics pipelines.
Viash component: A Python or R script with some meta that can be transformed into modular Nextflow modules by Viash.
Nextflow: A workflow management system that enables the development of portable and reproducible workflows.
Raw dataset: An unprocessed the dataset as generated by a dataset loader.
Dataset loader: A Viash component that downloads and stores the dataset as an AnnData file.
Common dataset: A processed dataset that follows a common format and is used as input for multiple benchmarking tasks.
Dataset processor: A Viash component that a common dataset into task-specific dataset objects.
Test resources: A set of files located at `resources_test/` that are used to test components and workflows.
